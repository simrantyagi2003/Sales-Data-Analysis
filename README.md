## Data Cleaning and Transformation Using Power Query Editor

*Cleaning Data: You've likely dealt with missing values, duplicates, or perhaps inconsistent data formats. This is a crucial step to ensure the accuracy of your analyses and visualizations.
Transformation: Transforming data might have involved pivoting, merging, or aggregating data to make it suitable for analysis. This step can significantly impact the performance and usability of your Power BI reports.
Creating Measures to Modify the Data
DAX Formulas: Creating measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) allows for dynamic calculations that adjust as your data or your report filters change. This is key to building a responsive and interactive dashboard.
Custom Calculations: Measures like Year-to-Date (YTD) calculations, percentages of total, or growth rates can provide deep insights and are essential for trend analysis.*

## Building an Interactive Dashboard in Power BI

*Visualization: Selecting the right charts and graphs is crucial for conveying your insights. Power BI offers a wide range of visualization options, from basic bar charts to more complex scatter plots or custom visuals.
Interactivity: Features like slicers, drill-throughs, and report tooltips make your dashboard interactive and allow users to explore the data in a meaningful way.
User Experience: Ensuring your dashboard is intuitive and easy to navigate is as important as the analyses themselves. Grouping related information and maintaining a clean layout help users understand the data better.*
